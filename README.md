# Simple-Online-Book-Store
The Online Bookstore is a Python-based web application that allows users to register, log in, browse books by subject, search for books by author or title, and manage their shopping cart. Users can also check out and receive an invoice for their orders. The application connects to a MySQL database to manage user data, book inventory, and orders.
